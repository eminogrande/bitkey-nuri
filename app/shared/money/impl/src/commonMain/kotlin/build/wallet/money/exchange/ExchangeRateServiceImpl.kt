  /**
   * Executes the sync of exchange rates.
   * This function encompasses multiple responsibilities that coordinate to keep the exchange rates
   * up-to-date.
   *
   * Initially, it caches the latest active F8e environment by collecting it into
   * [activeF8eEnvironmentState]. This value is used to determine the environment from which to fetch
   * exchange rates.
   *
   * Next, it sets up another coroutine to emit sync requests whenever the active F8e environment changes.
   * This reactivity ensures that any change in the environment triggers a sync of exchange rates.
   *
   * In addition to reacting to environment changes, the function includes a periodic sync mechanism.
   * A coroutine runs in an infinite loop, emitting sync requests every [periodicSyncDelay].
   * This guarantees regular updates, maintaining the exchange rates.
   *
   * When a sync request is emitted (through [syncRequests]), another coroutine listens to these
   * requests and initiates the update process for exchange rates. The exchange rates are written
   * to the local database. However, it only proceeds with the update if the app is in the foreground.
   * We don't want to update exchange rates unnecessarily when the app is in the background.
   *
   * Finally, to provide latest exchange rates through [exchangeRates], a coroutine is launched to
   * continuously update the [exchangeRatesCache] with the most recent exchange rates from the local
   * database. This ensures that the application always has the latest data.
