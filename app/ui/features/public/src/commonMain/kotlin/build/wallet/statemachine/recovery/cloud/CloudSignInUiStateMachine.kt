 * a logged out account is already present).
 * On iOS, this looks up currently signed iCloud account if any.
 *
 * Used both during onboarding for saving a backup and during recovery for accessing a backup.

 * account right away, instead of asking customer to go through sign in flow.
 * @property onSignInFailure handler for when customer cancels sign in (in case of Google drive),
 * we can't find a logged in account (in case of iCloud), or something else goes wrong.
 * @property onSignedIn handler for when customer successfully logged into a cloud account; or
