 * @property onExistingAppDataFound callback for when an existing cloud backup is found. The
 * cloudBackup passed as an argument will be null if the file could not be parsed, potentially
 * because it was a v1 backup from Beta.
 * @property isSkipCloudBackupInstructions attempt to start backup process without showing the
 * instructions or forcing sign out. This is used when the user has already seen the instructions
 * and we are attempting to re-do the backup. On the off chance that the CSEK is missing, we'll
 * still show the instructions even if this flag is set to true. See
